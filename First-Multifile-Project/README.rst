This project has three files:

main.cpp

compare.cpp

compare.h

The "compare.cpp" file contains one function, also named "compare". 
This function takes two integer reference parameters with names "param1" and "param2" and compares them.
It returns a single character based on what it sees. 

Just to prove that the "compare" function really does have access to your callerâ€™s variables, 
have the function flip the sign of each parameter before you process the return statement.

Ex:

param1 = -param1;

param2 = -param2;
